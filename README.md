#### Description

Organisations of all types collect vast amounts of time series data, and
there is a growing need for time series analytics to understand how
things change in our fast-moving world. This tutorial provides a
practical introduction to time series analytics and forecasting using R,
utilising the tidyverse and tidy time series tools to enable analysis
across many time series. Attendees will learn about commonly seen time
series patterns, and how to find them with specialised time series
graphics created with ggplot2. Then we will use fable to capture these
patterns with statistical time series models, and produce probabilistic
forecasts. Finally, participants will gain insights into evaluating
model performance, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of their
forecasts. Through a combination of foundational concepts and practical
demonstrations, this tutorial equips participants with the skills to
extract meaningful insights from time series data for informed
decision-making in various domains.

## Learning Outcomes

1.  How to use the tidyverse to wrangle and manipulate time series data.
2.  Visualise data and identify common time series patterns.
3.  Produce forecasts from a statistical model that captures dynamic
    time series patterns.
4.  Evaluate the modelâ€™s forecasting performance to select the best
    model.

#### Structure

- Time series exploratory data analysis
- Modelling and forecasting
- Accuracy evaluation

### Format

3 hour workshop.
